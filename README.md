## Setting up your own CompRetty application

In case you want to run a bot of your own, you can!

Make sure to download the [latest bot release](https://github.com/GleammerRay/CompRetty/releases) before proceeding.

### 1. Creating a link
1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal - My Applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. [A tutorial can be found here](https://github.com/discord-apps/bot-tutorial).
2. Go to URL Generator under OAuth2 and select bot scope with permissions to send messages.
3. Use the generated URL to invite the bot. ü§ñ

### 2. Setting up the config

1. Make a copy of `.env.template` named `.env` (removing the `.template` in the end).
2. Specify your Discord bot token in `COMPRETTY_BOT_TOKEN` in the `.env`. You can get it from the bot section of your Discord application.
3. Specify the owner ID in `COMPRETTY_OWNER_ID` in the `.env`. You can get it by enabling developer mode in Discord and right clicking on your username in any message, and the selecting `Copy ID`.
4. You are ready to run your bot! ü¶∏

### 3. Running the bot with NodeJS

1. Get [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (and npm if you're on linux).
2. Run `npm ci` in the root of bot directory to install dependencies.
3. Run `node start_bot.js` to run the bot. üèÉ

### 4. Making backups

All bot generated preferences including per-server preferences are saved in the `usrprefs` folder (or a different folder if you have changed `COMPRETTY_PREFS_PATH`). Make sure to back up this file regularly to avoid data loss. 

### 5. Updating

1. [Download and extract the latest available release](https://github.com/GleammerRay/CompRetty/releases).
2. Copy your `.env` file and `usrprefs` folder from old installation to the newly acquired release.
2. Run `npm ci` in the root of bot directory to install dependencies.
3. Enjoy the latest features! ‚ö°

### 6. Logging

By default, CompRetty is logging to your console.

If you wish to save the log, specify the `-s` or `--save-log` argument when running the bot. The log will then be saved to `bot.log` inside bot's directory.

Log message types:
- `I` - Informational message: contains relevant information about what the bot is doing.
- `W` - Warning: notifies about something that can cause runtime issues.
- `E` - Error: an unresolved runtime error. The bot will keep working, but its behaviour is not guaranteed.
- `F` - Fatal error: an error that caused the bot to crash.
- `S` - System message: contains relevant information about the bot process.

## Command line arguments

- `-h` / `--help` - Display help page.
- `-q` / `--quiet` - Do not log info and warnings into console. The `-s` option will not be affected.
- `-s` / `--save-log` - Save script log to a file. Default path is `bot.log` in parent directory, custom path can be specified with `-o`.
- `-o` / `--output <filepath>` - Specify a custom log output file path instead of `bot.log`.
- `-r` / `--restart` - Automatically restart the script on crash.
- `--raw` - Execute a raw run. The script will ignore all options and its output will not be formatted.
